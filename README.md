# Movies-My-Friends-Watch-On-Douban

This python program enables the user to generate a csv file of all the films watched by his/her friend on Douban, a Chinese version of IMDB. To run this, the user needs to create a txt file of links to his/her friends, you can refer to my sample file friends-movie.txt.

The program might run for hours, since there may be a lot of pages to check. For example, my program runs for about 4 hours by going through about 100,000 items. There is also a sample output csv file in this folder, where title of film, number of views by friends, number of rates by friends, average score among friends, and the Douban link are included.
